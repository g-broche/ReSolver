## Goal

Project to create a light piece of software to create dupplicates of an image with various resolutions and types each based on user created templates that are then added to user created presets.

## Intended usage

While creating content for my current web apps, one task i do a lot is to take an existing image (like a photo in .jpg format i took previously) and then make copies of it in .webp format and at various resolution for the purpose of optimization in an image srcset attribute.
To make this task less redundant i'd like to create a software able to handle this process.

## Context

Since Java is quite in demand in my area and because i wanted to extend my knowledge, i decided to learn the very basics of Java through a small project that i did before starting this project. This project is intended to be the next step in that learning process by this time adding the Spring framework to the dev environment. This project is also the opportunity to do a software oriented approach instead of a web solution and will let me experiment with JavaFX and FXML for the GUI.
